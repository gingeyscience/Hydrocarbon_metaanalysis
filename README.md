# PhD-Meta-analysis-Paper
This contains all of your code and data for the metaanalysis paper.

Purpose of the project:
- Determine the microbial communities of sampled oil and gas reservoirs in thr Taranaki region
- Compare how the A-NZ microbial communites look to international examples (primer-specific)
- Compare the international oil and gas communities to international water samples, are these distinct form other water communities?

You have a variety of .RMD files and collections of data
1. Aotearoa-New Zealand 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing code
   - Taranaki_Analysis
3. International Oil and Gas reservoir meta-analysis code
   - Hydrocarbon_Water_Dada2_alignment
   - Hydrocarbon_UNIFRAC
4. All water meta-analysis code
   - Hydrocarbon_Water_Dada2_alignment
   - Water_UNIFRAC

The Hydrocarbon_Water_Dada2_alignment.Rmd file contains all of the code performed for both the hydrocarbon analysis and the combined hydrocarbon-water analysis. Despite this being in one .Rmd, this analysis was done separately (the hydrocarbon was conducted first and then the water was completed afterwards)
