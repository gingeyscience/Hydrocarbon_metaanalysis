# PhD-Meta-analysis-Paper
This contains all of your code and data for you meta analysis paper.

Purpose of the project:
- Determine the microbial communities of sampled oil and gas reservoirs in thr Taranaki region
- Compare how the A-NZ microbial communites look to internatiopnal examples (primer-biased)
- Compare the international oil and gas communities to international water samples, are these distinct form other water communities?

You have a variety of .RMD files and collections of data
1. Aotearoa-New Zealand 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing code
2. International Oil and Gas reservoir meta-analysis code
3. All water meta-analysis code

There is also the files of the dada2 pipeline of the individual datasets

4. Dada2, A-NZ
5. Dada2, A-NZ + International
6. Dada2, all water

You also have all of the sequencing files for each of the three studies.
